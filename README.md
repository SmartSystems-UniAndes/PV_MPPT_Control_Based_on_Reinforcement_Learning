# Photo Voltaic MPPT Control Based on Reinforcement Learning

## About

This repository contains a study case of the work developed by Phan, B et al. in *A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based MPPT Control for PV Systems under Partial Shading Condition* [1]. Here is shown a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for MPPT (maximum power point tracking) control.

## Work Environment

To use this repository it is essential to use the 2020a version (or upper) of MATLAB.

## How to use

To run the complete study case, open the [EnvironmentMPPT.mlx file](EnvironmentMPPT.mlx) which is a MATLAB notebook, then run the **Set up the Environment**, this will open a window with the training process log.

If you want to observe the system architecture and the learning curves, open the [rlMpptModel.slx Simulink file](rlMpptModel.slx).

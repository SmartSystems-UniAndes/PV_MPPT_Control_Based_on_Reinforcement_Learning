# Photo Voltaic MPPT Control Based on Reinforcement Learning

## About

This repository contains a study case of the work developed by Phan, B et al. in *A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based MPPT Control for PV Systems under Partial Shading Condition* [1]. Here is shown a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for MPPT (maximum power point tracking) control.

## Work Environment

To use this repository it is essential to use the 2020a version (or upper) of MATLAB.

## How it works?

If you want to use the pretrained model and observe the final result: open the [*EnvironmentMPPT.mlx*](EnvironmentMPPT.mlx) MATLAB notebook file, then run **Set up the Environment** cell, then, run the first cell (*RL parameters*) of the **Create Networks**. A Simulink file with the PV architecture will be open, there you can change the parameters *lr1*, *lr2*, *lr3* and *T1* as you wish, then run the simulation and observe its behavior. Now, if you want to re-train the model, run all the cells in *EnvornmentMPPT.mlx*, which will open a window with the train process.

It examines the use of {ML} applied to control, islanding detection, management, fault detection and diagnosis, forecasting irradiance and power generation, sizing, and site adaptation in {PV} systems. The contribution of this work is three fold: first, we review more than 100 research articles, most of them from the last five years, that applied state-of-the-art {ML} techniques in {PV} systems; second, we review resources where researchers can find open data-sets, source code, and simulation environments that can be used to test {ML} algorithms; third, we provide a case study for each of one of the topics with open-source code and data to facilitate researchers interested in learning about these topics to introduce themselves to implementations of up-to-date {ML} techniques applied to {PV} systems. Also, we provide some directions, insights, and possibilities for future development.},
